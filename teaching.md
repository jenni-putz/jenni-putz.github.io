<!--<font size="4"><p>At the University of Oregon, I have taught seven undergraduate courses as an instructor of record--in econometrics, intermediate microeconomic theory, and environmental and natural resource economics. These were large courses that also involved managing teaching assistants. I have also been a teaching assistant for six econometrics courses, including the first-year PhD econometrics course. I received the 2021 Department of Economics Graduate Teaching Award. Below, you can find summaries of the courses I have taught, along with syllabi, other course materials, and examples of student feedback. Note that the University of Oregon transitioned away from quantitative teaching evaluations in Fall 2019, so most of my feedback is qualitative. <br>

	<li><b>ECON 202: Principles of Microeconomics</b><br>
		<a href="/EC202_Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li>
		<p> The purpose of this course is to cultivate students' economic intuition. A main goal of the course is to teach studens how to think as an economist. We will consider how social outcomes are shaped by the decisions of many individuals, even though each individual commands only a small fraction of the economy. Expanding upon the notion that individuals respond to incentives, we will use models to analyze and assess a variety of social phenomena. Successful students will leave the course with an intellectual framework for understanding and evaluating economic issues and policy.</p>
	<li><b>ECON 336: Environmental Economics</b><br>	
		<a href="/EC336_Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li>
		<p> This course focuses on applying basic economic theory to natural and environmental resources problems. Topics include economic perspectives on the concepts of sustainability and natural resource scarcity (static and dynamically efficient allocations) for nonrenewable or depletable resources (minerals, groundwater), optimal management of renewable resources (surface water, fisheries, forests), and pollution management strategies (including use of economic incentives such as pollution taxes and/or tradable permits, and legal liability for pollution control). </p>
		<li><b>ECON 415: Introduction to Econometrics</b><br>
		<p>This course introduces the statistical techniques that help economists learn about the world using data. We will focus much of our attention on regression analysis, the workhorse of applied econometrics. We apply the insights of theory to work with and learn from actual data using R, a statistical programming language. Topics include simple and multiple regressoin, nonlinear regression, simulations, and an introduction to machine learning methods for economics.</p>
	<li><b>ECON 455W/555: Cost-Benefit Analysis</b><br>
		<a href="/EC455W_Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li>
		<p>Cost-benefit analysis involves the use of microeconomics to assess the costs and benefits of policies or investments. Drawing on a mixture of economic theory and real-life studies, this course provides students with the theoretical foundations and practical skills to understand, assess, and conduct cost-benefit analyses. </p>
<li><b>ECON 480W/580: International Trade</b><br>
		<p>International Trade and Theory is an examination of the microeconomic foundations of international trade. We will focus on the historical evolution of trade theories that explain why nations trade, how they gain from trade, and the welfare implications of trade. We will also cover the influence of government intervention on trade flows (tariffs, quotas) and international factor movements (immigration, foreign direct investment). </p>	
<li><b>ECON 511: Mathematical Economics</b><br>
		<a href="/EC511_Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li>
		<p> Survey of mathematical techniques used in contemporary economic analysis. Topics include applications of linear algebra, multivariable calculus, integration, and optimization theory to micro and macro economics. </p>

	    <li> <b>EC 311: Intermediate Microeconomics</b> (Summer 2019, Fall 2020, Spring 2022) <br>
	    <a href="/EC311Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus, </a><a href="/EC311_F20_Syllabus.pdf">  Remote Syllabus</a></li>
	    <p> The objective of this course is to provide students with an overview of the most important theoretical concepts in microeconomics. Upon completing the course, students should feel comfortable solving the mathematical problems that allow them to build basic models of markets and using their
intuitive understanding of the problems to explain the relationship between market inputs--like preferences, technologies, and costs--and market outputs--like price and quantity. The most important mathematical objective is to develop the ability to perform constrained optimization in the context of these classic economic problems. </p>
	    <li> <b>EC 333: Resource and Environmental Economic Issues</b> (Spring 2020, Winter 2021) <br>
	    <a href="/EC333_Syllabus_1.pdf">Syllabus</a><br></li>
	    <p> This course focuses on applying basic economic theory to natural and environmental resources problems. Topics include economic perspectives on the concepts of sustainability and natural resource scarcity for nonrenewable or depletable resources, optimal management of renewable resources, and pollution management strategies. By the end of the course, students will be familiar with the economic models pertaining to issues of allocation and management of natural resources and environmental goods, have an expanded understanding of externalities, and will be familiar with how economists conduct benefit-cost analysis of alternative allocations of environmental goods where markets do not exist. </p>
	    <li> <b>EC 320: Introduction to Econometrics (I)</b> (Summer 2021, Fall 2021) <br>
	    <a href="/EC320_Syllabus_Summer21.pdf">Syllabus</a><br></li>
	    <p> This course introduces the statistical techniques that help economists learn about the world using data--with much of the course focusing on regression analysis. Using calculus and introductory statistics, we will cultivate a working understanding of the theory underpinning regression analysis. During the course, students will apply the insights of theory to work with and learn from actual data using R, a statstical programming language. By the end of the course, students will be able to understand the theory behind linear regression, estimate a linear regression using R, identify the conditions for OLS validity, and interpret the results.	 </p>

<font size="4"><ul>
    <li> It was an awesome class, I hope Prof. Putz continues to teach economics at the UO, her future students will be very lucky when they have her as an instructor. - EC 333</li>
    <li>I have absolutely loved this course . The material was interesting and the instructor was knowledgeable about all of it. I was never bored during lectures and they were designed to keep my attention. Thank you for being an awesome instructor and being so accommodating. - EC 333</li>
    <li>The way that Jenni presents and explains the material works very well for me and my perception is that it works well for the others in the class as well. Honestly, concepts that didn’t quite click in EC201, clicked perfectly when we reviewed them on day one of EC311... She keeps us engaged; encourages participation; is prompt when replying to questions via email; is available and flexible with office hours; pauses during lecture to provide alternate explanations to problems when needed; and, because she is writing things out as she explains them, is ensuring that we are really taking in the material covered. It is clear that she takes the time to prepare for class and knows the material she is presenting backwards and sideways. - EC 311</li>
 <li>She is extremely knowledgable about what is talking about and makes concepts that are harder to grasp easier to understand. She is extremely patient and able to word explanations in multiple different ways in order for each and every student to understand. Ms. Putz is extremely approachable and creates an awesome learning environment. - EC 421 Lab</li>
